            My name is Justin Florence and I'm currently a math and computer science student at nc state working as a research assistant in Proffessor Blondin's Lab at NC state. Im currently looking for any internships in the fields of data analytics, parrallel/scietific computing, or machine learning.

        As of right now I'm currently trying to model the relationship between rotational speed, luminosity, and mass loss in Vela-X1, a binary star system using 2D and 3D simualtions.
        </p>
        <p class="subtext"> An exponential relationship showed between rotational speed and the mass loss at the edge of the star's boundary </p>

        Recently, I was taught a certain method of interpolation given a limited set of data to extrapolate points from an unknown function. This method is called Newtonian Interpolation. I used a method called ivided difference to
        calculate the polynomial's coefficients. I then used Shor's algorithm to evaluate the polynomial for a very large number of values. I created a user friendly application in java that asks the user how many points they will enter, whether they want to graph the function or look up a specific value, and then returns
        n data points specified by the user in a .dat file in whatever directory they choose. The user can then use a free graphing software such as gnuplot to visualize the points. The polynomial generated can be compared to a previously known function or can be used to approximate values outside a certain domain.
    </p>
    <p class="deg6th"> On the left, we have a comparison of a sixth degree polynomial to the know function, 1/(25t^2+1).</p>
    <p class="deg6th"> On the right, we have a graph comparing the log of the absolute difference between a degree 6, 12, and 20 polynomial to compare the accurary of each.</p>
